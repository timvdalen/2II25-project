Our aim is to use modern tools and technologies for this project, to make the most of recent developments since the Web Technlogy field moves very fast.

\begin{description}
	\item[git]\hfill\\
		We will use \textit{git} for our source code management.
		
	\item[GitHub]\hfill\\
		We will use \textit{GitHub} as our \textit{git} host. Even though it is technically not needed because of the distributed nature of \textit{git}, \textit{GitHub} makes it easy to manage our project.
	
	\item[Repushitory]\hfill\\
		To deploy our code to our server, we will use \href{https://github.com/nubisonline/repushitory}{nubisonline/repushitory}.

	\item[LESS]\hfill\\
		To style our pages, we will use \textit{CSS} with \textit{LESS} as the preprocessor.

	\item[jQUery]\hfill\\
		We will use \textit{jQuery} to easily select element from our \textit{DOM}, to abstract from browser specific code and to manage our \textit{AJAX} requests.

	\item[Bootstrap]\hfill\\
		Bootstrap is a \textit{CSS} suite (with some JS tools) that contains a lot of base blocks for \textit{CSS}, like various buttons.
		We will use it for its great form and typography elements.

	\item[JSON]\hfill\\
		The data we send between our back- and front-end (using AJAX) will be encoded in the \textit{JSON} data format.
